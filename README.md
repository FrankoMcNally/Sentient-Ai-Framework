Sentient Ai Framework 
Sentient AI Framework
The Sentient AI Framework is an innovative modular system designed to simulate lifelike AI behavior by integrating emotional intelligence, DNA-inspired customization, and advanced reasoning capabilities. Whether you’re exploring its potential for gaming NPCs, conversational AI, or research applications, this framework offers unparalleled adaptability and scalability.

Features
Emotionally Adaptive AI
Real-time emotional regulation for dynamic and human-like interactions.

DNA-Inspired Customization
Define cognitive and emotional traits using DNA-like sequences to create unique AI personalities.

Advanced Reasoning Layers
Includes Prime Reasoning for entropy analysis and decision-making based on stability patterns.

Observer Module
Tracks and summarizes interactions, providing actionable insights and transparent logs.

Scalable Memory Management
Efficient memory compression and retrieval inspired by DNA data structures.

Use Cases
Gaming: Create NPCs with emotional depth and adaptive behaviors.
Chatbots: Develop AI with personality and memory for engaging conversations.
Research: Analyze complex data with advanced reasoning layers.
Education: Enable learning assistants with customizable traits.
Installation
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
Required Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
Install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentient-ai-framework.git
cd sentient-ai-framework
Run the framework:

bash
Copy
Edit
python sentient_framework.py
Quick Start
Load a DNA Profile
Customize AI traits by defining a DNA sequence:

python
Copy
Edit
dna_sequence = "AATTCCGG"
framework.load_dna_profile(dna_sequence)
Simulate Emotional Inputs
Provide input data to observe emotional regulation:

python
Copy
Edit
inputs = {"joy": 0.8, "anger": 0.3, "curiosity": 0.7}
result = framework.process_inputs(inputs)
print(result)
Log Interactions
Use the Observer Module to track AI behavior:

python
Copy
Edit
observer.summarize_logs()
